 Statement  of Purpose  
 
The 2022  Block -Group Level Planning Database (also called the PDB) is a data set that contains  a range of 
housing, demographic,  socioeconomic, and census operational data. The se data  have been extracted 
from  2020 Census and  2016 -2020 American Community Survey (ACS) data sources , and summarized for 
all block groups  in the country  and the territory o f Puerto Rico. The PDB is generally  updated annually and 
made publicly available.  The prior version was the 20 21 PDB, which was  created using 2010 Census and 
2015-2019 American Community Survey data.  
The PDB can be used in many ways, including:  
 
• Identifying areas where special outreach and promotion efforts could be considered  
• Linking spatial map data files to create thematic maps  
• Generating reports, cross tabulations, and simple analyses  
• Planning recruitment  activities by Regional Census Centers, and Local Census Offices  
• Educational purposes  
 
History  
In 1987, the first documentation of elements for developing a “Planning Database” was written by 
Antonio Bruce at the Census Bureau1.  Discussion continued in the 1990s, and the first completed PDB 
was a county -level dataset during this decade which was not publicly released .  After the 2000 Census , 
an updated  “2000  PDB” was the first to become publicly available, and contained data from the 2000 
Census at the tract level2.  This  PDB contained 48 variables  for 65,184 tracts; these included  total  
counts  for population and housing units,  various percentages for housing and dem ographic 
characteristics,  mail return rates, and a derived metric known as the “Hard To Count (HTC)” score3. 
The HTC score summarizes the attributes of each tract in terms of enumeration difficulty.  
After the 2010 Census , an updated versi on of the file was created, referred to as  the 2012 PDB.  This 
differed from the 2000 PDB in that it contained data from the 2010 decennial census, including 
operational variables such as the 2010 mail return rate, and that the data was provided at the block 
group level  rather than tract level4.  In addition, it included American Community Survey (ACS) 
estimates based on 5 -year data from 2006 -2010, along with margins of error for each estimate.  Thus, 
the 2012 PDB updated and expanded the data from the 2000 PDB, wi th a new total of 179 variables  
for 220,335  block groups.    
 
1 Bruce, Antonio.  1987. “Identifying Hard -to-Enumerate Areas: Preliminary Research and Evaluation”, unpublished 
paper, Washington, D.C., U.S. Bureau of the Census.  
2 Census tracts are small, relatively permanent sta tistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are updated 
by local participants prior to each decennial census and generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people.  These are divided into census block groups, which are in turn divided into blocks.  Each of these terms and 
others are defined in a Census glossary located at https://www.census.gov/programs -
surveys/geography/abo ut/glossary.html.  
3 The set of algorithms used to define HTC score is listed in the documentation for the 2000 PDB, located at 
https://www2.census.gov/programs -surveys/research/guidance/planning -databases/2000/pdb -tract -2000.pdf .  
4 Block groups are statistical divisions of census tracts and generally contain between 300 and 6,000 people.  
4  
 Starting in 2014, the PDB has been updated and released each year  (except 2017)  at both the tract 
and block group level s.  Also, starting in 201 8, each version of the PDB has been provided through  a 
Census Application Programming Interface (API)5.  The exact number of variables, tracts, or block 
groups has varied in each version of the PDB.   However, e ach version prior to the 2022 PDB has 
contained data from the 2010 Census and the most recent 5 -year ACS data available.  The 2022 PDB is 
the first version containing data from the 2020 Census, along with the most recent 5 -year ACS data 
available.  
One new statistic beginning in 2014 was the replacement of the HTC score with  the “ Low Response 
Score” (LRS).   The LRS is a predicted value of self- response at the tract level. Results were used for 
geographic targeting of outreach efforts.   Other ACS variable names and definitions may change 
between years as well.   
An additional categorical variable was added in 2019 for the tract level PDB known as the 
“Segmentation Profile;” each category for this variable identifies census tracts with similar predicted 
self-response behavior and similar demographic variables associated with self- response.  Another 
addition to the 2019 PDB at the tract level was the ACS self- response rate; the Census Bureau plans to 
add this statistic based on the latest 5 -year ACS data going forward.  Finally, a special one -time release 
of the 2020 PDB was issued at the state and county level.  
 
Limitations of the Data  
 
Data contained in the 202 2 PDB are subject to nonsampling error. In addition, the ACS data are also 
subject to sampling error.  Both of these are described in more detail in Appendix A.  
 
In addition, a unique limitation of the 2022 PDB is that it is a limited release, with a smaller set of 
variables  compared to previous years’ versions of the PDB. Some of these excluded variables are the 
LRS, the Segmentation Profile, and 2020 Census operational variables.  As more 2020 Census data 
become available, future PDB releases will contain a new LRS and additional Census variables.  However, none of the ACS variables that typically appear in previous versions of the PDB are omitted from the 2022 PDB.

 File Structure  of the Database  
 
The 202 2 PDB is available in a .CSV format, as well as in API. The data file contains  242,335 total 
observations. Users should take caution when saving the entire .CSV file as an Excel workbook 
because of Excel’s row number limit. The first row of the data file contains variable numbers for each 
column that can be used  to match the variable names against the variable numbers used in this 
document. The value of cells  in the PDB may not be shown for block groups  containing small 
populations or few housing units; cell s with missing data are denoted by blank values. Data 
suppression of ACS estimates limits the disclosure of information about individual respondents and 
reduces the number of estimates with unacceptable levels of statistical reliability. More information 
about data suppression in ACS data can be found here:  https://www.census.gov/programs -
surveys/acs/technical -documentation/data -suppression.html . 
 
The 202 2 PDB contains data from two major source files:  
 
1. 2020 Census data * – Population and housing 
2. 2016 – 2020 5- year ACS Summary File * – Population, housing, and socioeconomic  
*The ACS Summary File consists of comprehensive sets of tabular data that are also published on 
data.census.gov.  Statistics downloaded from data.census.gov receive  clearances from  the Disclosure 
Review Board before being posted. No  clearance number  is required at this time for such information 
products.  
The first  100+  variables in the 202 2 PDB are estimates directly taken or derived from the two sources 
mentioned above. The remaining variables are estimated percentages calculated by  dividing 
estimates by their given denominator. All percentages were calculated using variables in this file, and the accompanying MOEs were calculated using the method s published in  Chapters 7 -8 of 
Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handboo
k_2020.pdf ).  
 
 
Description  of Variables  in the Database  
 
This section contains descriptions of all variables in the 202 2 PDB at the block group  level. For readers 
and data users interested in more details for these variables, additional documentation for the 
decennial data can be found in the 2020 Census State Redistricting Data (Public Law 94 -171)  Summary 
File: Technical Documentation (2020 Census State Redistricting Data (Public  Law 94- 171) Summary 
File),  and for ACS data, documentation can be found in “the American Community Survey and Puerto 
Rico Community Survey 201 8 Subject Definitions (https://www2.census.gov/programs -
surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2018_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf ).   
 
1. Level of Geography: The PDB contains one record per block group. Except where noted, counts 
enable the user to ag gregate the data to the block group  level or to higher units of geography. 
7  
 When aggregating to higher geographies, the user should be aware that block groups  with 
missing values may not be represented in the resulting summary.  
2. Counts versus Percents: While both count estimates and percentage estimates have been 
provided, the appropriate variables to be used as denominators when calculating percentages 
from co unt variables are noted.  
3. Median values: Selected median values are also provided. A blank percentage value indicates 
that the numerator or denominator used in its calculation was missing, or the denominator had a 
value of zero. Median household income and median house value are provided for the block 
group and for the tract in which the block group is located.  
4. Census versus ACS variables: For variables in which both census and ACS estimates are available, 
both are provided. Because the PDB is updated annual ly, the ACS estimates show estimated 
change in these measures since 2020  as the decade progresses. The 201 6 – 2020 ACS 5 -year 
estimates are based on data collected between January 201 6 and December 20 20. They 
represent average characteristics over the 5 -year period, and thus have a larger sample size than 
1-year ACS estimates but are less current than 1 -year ACS estimates. Sources of all variables are 
indicated; “20 20 Census” refers to data items from the 20 20 decennial census, and “ACS” refers 
to ACS data items asked of the persons and housing units in the 201 6 to 20 20 ACS samples.  
5. Margin of Error: ACS estimates appear with the margin of error (MOE) associated with the 
estimate. Some custom measures were created by aggregating published estimates; the MOEs of 
such aggregates were derived from published MOEs and may differ from MOEs i n other data 
products. Variable labels indicate which MOEs were derived. Please see Appendix A. Margin of Error Calculations  of this document for more information about how these derived MOEs were 
calculated and how to calculate MOEs when creating custom aggregate estimates.  
6. Place and Time: The geographic vintage of the block groups and tracts in this file are from 20 20 
Census geography.  “Census geography” refers to the basic geographic data associated with the 
items.  The Cen sus Bureau updates geographic identifiers and boundaries between censuses in 
rare instances. Data from the 201 6 – 2020 ACS 5 -year estimates use the most recent geographic 
identifiers .  More information about geographic variables can be found in Appendix D of this 
document, as well as here:  https://www.census.gov/programs -
surveys/geography/about/glossary.html
. 
 
Block groups  deemed uninhabitable are indicated with the Flag variable. These block groups have a 
zero census population but, due to the nature of t he ACS estimates, may contain ACS population 
estimates.

Appendix  A. Margin  of Error Calculations  and  Nonsampling  Error  
 
The 202 2 PDB provides ACS small area estimates that are easily accessible by a wide range of users. It 
is important to note that these small area estimates are estimates, with accompanying sampling error.  
The Margin of Error (MOE) for any estimate needs to be cons idered when using any single estimate, as 
it provides the best indicator of the variability across units within the estimate. There are various  
accepted formulas for calculating MOEs. An advisory group in the development of the Tract PDB  
decided to use t he formula noted in  Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: 
What All Data Users Need to Know (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook
_2020.pdf ) for calculating MOEs from grouped summary data.   
 
A review of the coefficients of variation (which measure the standard deviation of an estimate relative  
to the mean) reveals those estimates with a large CV, which suggests a less reliable estimate. Generally, 
small sample sizes are more prone to large MOEs, which in turn lead to larger CVs. The small sample 
can be the result of a characteristic of low incidence in the population or the result of subpopulations 
within a population.  
 
As a result, we caution against taking any single estimate with a large MOE as absolute. The key is that 
unstable estimates should not be used for decisions about individual trac ts. We recognize the 
importance of small area data to aid in planning and operational activities. However, we make these data available for summing to higher levels of geography where the data can be useful, such as Census 
Designated Places, Local Census O ffices, or any collection of tracts that bear on the activity at hand. 
We ask that the user of the block group data note the limitations of the estimates to those who may 
be using the data for decision purposes.  
The margin of error around an estimate is im portant because it helps data users draw conclusions 
about the reliability of the data. Small differences between two estimates may not be statistically 
significant if the confidence intervals of those estimates overlap. However, the Census Bureau 
cautions  data users not to rely on overlapping confidence intervals as a test for statistical significance, 
because this method will not always produce accurate results. Instead, the Census Bureau 
recommends following the detailed instructions for conducting stati stical significance tests in Chapter 
7 of Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know 
(https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook

In some cases, dat a users will need to construct custom ACS estimates by combining data across  
multiple geographic areas or population subgroups, or it may be necessary to derive a new percentage, 
proportion, or ratio from published ACS data. In such cases, additional calc ulations are needed to 
produce confidence intervals and margins of error for the derived estimates.   Chapters 7 -8 of 
Understanding and Using American Community Survey Data: What All Data Users Need to Know 
 
38  (https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/acs/acs_general_handbook_
2020.pdf ) provides detailed instructions on how to make these calculations.  Please note that published 
margins of error, when available, should always be used over calculated measures of error.  
Note that these er ror measures do not tell us about the magnitude of nonsampling errors.  To learn 
more about nonsampling error in the 201 6 – 2020 ACS, please see the section titled “Control of 
Nonsampling Error” in American Community Survey Multiyear Accuracy of the Data ( 5-year 201 6-2020):

 Appendix B. Calculating Response Rates  
 
Prior versions of the PDB contained decennial variables such as the Mail Response Rate and Mail Return 
Rate for the 2010 Census.  Normally this appendix would be used to describe the formulas for these 
variables.  However, these variables are omitted from the 2022 PDB regarding the 2020 Census  due to 
data availability at the time of publication .  They will be reintroduced to  future versions of the PDB as 
they become available .   
40  
 Appendix  C. Key  Estimates of the Planning Database  
 
Twenty  variables were identified as key estimates of the 2022  PDB. Some of these variables would 
be used to calculate the LRS  (which is not included in the 2022 PDB) , while others are newer 
variables that may be of interest to users. To assess the quality of these estimates, the median 
coefficient of variation and the median item nonresponse rate were calculated. The results are 
presented in the following table. Of th e 20 variables, 9 have a median coefficient of variation below 
30.00, and all but two applicable variables have a median item missing rate below 30.00.

 Appendix  D. Changes  to Geography  
 
Geographic numbering and definitions can change over time. Generally, major changes to geographic 
boundaries are made during the decennial census, but errors in boundary definitions or numbering 
may lead to updates in the intervening years. For the 2022 PD B, the number of block groups is 242,335, 
based on 2020 Census geography.  This is a change from prior versions of the PDB, in which the 
number of block groups was approximately 220,000 based on 2010 Census geography.

   Appendix  E. Changes  to ACS Variables  
 
ACS variable names  and definitions can change over time.  The Census Bureau provides detailed tables 
for all ACS 5 -year estimates, and several new or modified tables were provided for the 2016 -2020 ACS 5 -
year estimat es.  While no names or definitions changed for any ACS variables in the 2022 PDB compared 
to the previous year, there are a number of new variables pertaining to two demographics.  These 
demographics are: (i) the multi-racial population  that is not Hispani c or Latino , and (ii) the population of 
adults age 25 or older having their highest level of education at Grade 6 or less.  For each of these populations, there are four ACS variables, reflecting: (i) the number of people meeting these criteria, (ii) the m argin of error of this number, (iii) the percentage of people meeting these criteria, and (iv) the 
margin of error of this percentage.  In addition, for the multi- racial population, the 2022 PDB has two 
variables based on 2020 Census data, reflecting: (i) the number of people meeting these criteria, and (ii) the percentage of people meeting these criteria.  
 Other new or modified tables were provided by the Census Bureau for the 2016 -2020 ACS, but these 
did not impact the 2022 PDB.  For a full description o f the 2016 -2020 ACS 5 -year estimates and the new, 
modified, or deleted tables, please see technical documentation located at 
https://www.census.gov/programs -surveys/acs/technical- documentation/table -and-geography -
changes/2020/5 -year.html .
